	<h2>Creative Blacktie (blacktie.es)</h2>
	
			<img src="images/creative_blacktie.png" width="1246" height="638" 
			alt="Creative Blacktie Homepage" />
	
		<p>
			Creative Blacktie's site organization is amazing. They have great 
			use of the &lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;
			tags along with id's to make their site almost organizationally
			perfect.

	<h2>edgarleijs.com</h2>
		
			<img src="images/edgarleijs.png" width="1263" height="638"
			alt="Edgar Leijs Homepage" />
			
		<p>
			Edgar's site is simple enough that you think he would have some
			pretty good organization. Despite his use of &lt;header&gt; and
			&lt;section&gt;, his site has but one section named.
		</p>

	<h2>mynus.sk</h2>

			<img src="images/mynus.png" width="1230" height="635" alt="mynus.sk homepage" />

		<p>
			mynus.sk has a descent page outline. There are a couple untitled sections, but that can easily changed by adding some id's to his sections.
		</p>

	<h2>redlinepe.co.uk<h3>

			<img src="images/relinepe.png" width="1229" height="644" alt="redline engineering homepage" />

		<p>
			redline's homepage is not set up very well in the outline. They have two untitled sections and have almost no heirarchy at all. They could use some subsections underneath their main ones.
